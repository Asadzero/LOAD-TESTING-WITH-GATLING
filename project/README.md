### Load Testing Scenarios
- **Load Test**: Gradual ramp-up testing normal to peak loads (5-50 users/sec)
- **Stress Test**: High concurrency testing to find breaking points (up to 400 users/sec)
- **Spike Test**: Sudden traffic spikes to test system resilience (up to 2000 users/sec)
- **Endurance Test**: 30-minute sustained load testing for stability

### User Journey Simulation
- **Registration & Shopping Flow** (40% weight)
- **Login & Purchase Flow** (35% weight)
- **Product Search & Browse** (20% weight)
- **Analytics Dashboard Access** (5% weight)

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

The testing suite measures:
- **Response Times**: Average, 95th percentile, and max response times
- **Throughput**: Requests per second and concurrent users
- **Error Rates**: Failed requests and error distribution
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU utilization
- **Endpoint Performance**: Per-endpoint performance breakdown

## ðŸ›  Setup & Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Test Server
```bash
npm run server
```
The server will start on port 3001 with sample data loaded.

### 3. Run Load Tests

#### Individual Tests
```bash
# Standard load test (7 minutes)
npm run test:load

# Stress test (7.5 minutes) 
npm run test:stress

# Spike test (2.5 minutes)
npm run test:spike

# Endurance test (30 minutes)
npm run test:endurance
```

#### All Tests
```bash
npm run test:all
```

#### Combined Server + Tests
```bash
npm run start:test-server
```

### 4. View Results
- Real-time metrics in terminal during test execution
- HTML reports generated in `reports/` directory
- JSON results for programmatic analysis

## ðŸ“‹ Test Configuration

### Load Test Phases
1. **Warm up** (60s): 5 users/sec - System initialization
2. **Normal load** (120s): 20 users/sec - Typical traffic
3. **Peak load** (180s): 50 users/sec - High traffic periods
4. **Cool down** (60s): 10 users/sec - Traffic reduction

### Stress Test Phases
1. **Baseline** (30s): 10 users/sec
2. **Stress Level 1** (60s): 100 users/sec
3. **Stress Level 2** (120s): 200 users/sec
4. **Breaking Point** (180s): 400 users/sec
5. **Recovery** (60s): 50 users/sec

### API Endpoints Tested
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/products` - Product listing with pagination/filtering
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Individual product details
- `GET /api/cart` - Shopping cart retrieval
- `POST /api/cart` - Add items to cart
- `POST /api/orders` - Order creation
- `GET /api/orders` - Order history
- `GET /api/analytics` - Performance analytics
- `GET /health` - Health check

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Analysis

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Response Time**: Target < 200ms for product endpoints
- **Throughput**: Minimum 1000 RPS for read operations
- **Error Rate**: Maximum 1% under normal load
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime under sustained load

### Bottleneck Identification
The test suite helps identify:
- Database query performance issues
- Authentication overhead
- Memory leaks during sustained load
- Connection pool exhaustion
- CPU-intensive operations

### Scalability Insights
- **Horizontal scaling** readiness assessment
- **Vertical scaling** resource requirements
- **Caching** strategy effectiveness
- **Load balancer** configuration optimization

## ðŸ”§ Customization

### Modifying Test Scenarios
Edit YAML files in `tests/` directory:
- Adjust arrival rates and durations
- Add new user journeys
- Modify request payloads
- Configure custom assertions

### Adding New Endpoints
1. Implement endpoints in `server/index.js`
2. Add test scenarios in YAML files
3. Update test weights and flows

### Custom Metrics
Extend `test-functions.js` for:
- Custom response validation
- Business-specific metrics
- Advanced user simulation
